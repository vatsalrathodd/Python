# The difference between list and Tuples is that you cannot update Tuples

# Creating Tuple using ()
t = (1,2,3,4,5)

# Empty Tuple
# t1 = ()
# print(t1) 

# Another way to write Empty Tuple
t2 = (1,)  # Correct Way to write tuple
t3 = (1)   # Wrong way. This represents only a number so comma is required
print(t2)
print(t3)

# Printing Tuples
# print(t)

# Cannot update tuple value
# t[0] = 100
